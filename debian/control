Description: highly flexible status line for the i3-gaps window manager
 Status line for the i3-gaps window manager and i3bar that handles clicks, signals
 and language-agnostic user scripts.
 .
 The content of each block (e.g. time, battery status, network state, ...)
 is the output of a command provided by the user.  Blocks are updated on click,
 at a given interval of time or on a given signal, also specified by the user.
 .
 It aims to respect the i3bar protocol, providing customization such as text
 alignment, urgency, color, and more.
